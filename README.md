Project Summary

This Flour4four project builds a simple data pipeline using Airflow, PySpark, and Docker.

Raw CSV data is cleaned and transformed with PySpark, then saved as Parquet files for better performance and storage efficiency.
The pipeline is orchestrated with an Airflow DAG, with each step implemented as a separate Python script.
